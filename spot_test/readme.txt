This map uses a handful of entities to create a spotlight that follows
the players' crosshair, and turns on with a left click.
However, for an unknown reason, the spotlight falls off the pillar it is
standing on when you start using it. To solve it until I (or someone
else) find a fix, just make a few clicks and turns and it should come
back.
